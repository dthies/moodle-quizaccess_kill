quizaccess_kill
=================

This is a quiz access rule for Moodle Quiz that adds an instant kill
option to the Immediate feedback behaviour.

Copy this directory to quiz/accessrule/kill in the Moodle source
directory. Login as admin to complete plugin installation.  Then set
up a quiz using immediate feedback and enable the Qick kill setting
underneath the behaviour setting. When students attempt the quiz and
check an answer for a question the attempt will be submitted immediately
if they do not have the answer completly correct.
